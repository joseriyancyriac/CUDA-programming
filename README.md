# CUDA Programming Playground

A learning and experimentation repository for exploring GPU-accelerated programming technologies.

## About This Repository

This is my personal playground for diving into CUDA and various GPU programming concepts that I've wanted to explore but haven't had the time to dig into until now. It's a collection of experiments, tests, and implementations as I learn and get hands-on with different technologies in the GPU computing space.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Learning experiments** with CUDA programming fundamentals
- **Technology exploration** of different GPU computing frameworks
- **Proof-of-concept implementations** and testing grounds
- **Integration experiments** that may eventually connect with:
  - Robotics applications
  - Control system strategies
  - Other domains where GPU acceleration could be beneficial

## Future Directions

While this started as a learning exercise, the code and concepts developed here may eventually find their way into more serious projects. The goal is to build up knowledge and practical experience that can be applied to real-world problems in robotics, control systems, or other areas where high-performance computing makes a difference.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in CUDA installation and setup, check out the [installation guide](docs/installation.md) for detailed instructions on setting up CUDA 13.0 with NVIDIA drivers on Ubuntu 22.04.
